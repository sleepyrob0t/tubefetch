# Tubefetch

Tubefetch is a Python script that allows a user to download a Youtube video from a given URL. First, the program will ask the user to input a valid link to a youtube link. The code will then check to see if the URL is valid. If the user inputs an invalid URL, then the program will ask the user again to input a valid URL. If the URL is valid then the video will be downloaded.

# Libraries Used

Pytube: Lightweight, dependency-free Python library which is used for downloading videos from the web.

# Contribute 

If you want to contribute to this repository, feel free to do so. Currently, I am working on adding a Graphical User Interface to the program as well as a feature that asks the user the quality of the video that they want to download.
